[24/11/24, 19:45:37] Lokesh Nmi College: Here are **10 SQL practice questions** for each topic as requested:  

---

### **DDL (Data Definition Language)**  
1. Create a table `bus_type` with columns `type_id (INT PRIMARY KEY)`, `type_name (VARCHAR(20))`.  
2. Alter the `fleet_header` table to add a column `bus_status` (VARCHAR(10)) with default value 'active'.  
3. Rename the column `fare` in the `route_header` table to `ticket_price`.  
4. Drop the table `route_detail` if it exists.  
5. Add a `NOT NULL` constraint to the `fare` column in the `route_header` table.  
6. Create an index on the `origin` and `destination` columns in the `route_header` table.  
7. Change the datatype of the `distance` column in `route_header` to `DECIMAL(5,2)`.
